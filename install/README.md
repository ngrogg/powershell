# Install

A series of scripts for installing powershell. </br> 
So far there are the following: </br>
* powershellInstallDebian.sh, A BASH script I used to install the .deb file on Debian 11.
* powershellInstallSnap.sh, A BASH script I used to install powershell via snap on Debian Sid.

</br>
I'll add new scripts as I make them.
