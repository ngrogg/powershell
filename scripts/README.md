Scripts that I've written for Powershell. </br>

## Scripts 
**helloWorld**, the simple 'hello world' script to test that everything is configured and working on your system. </br>

Usage, just run the script </br>

**diskSpace**, A Powershell script to find the largest files and folders at a provided filepath.
Takes a filepath as an argument, doesn't have to be C:\ drive. For best results run in admin powerShell prompt. </br>

**userCreation**, A Powershell script to create a user. Creates an admin user by default.
A version is in progress to create an admin or non-admin user. Takes a username, first name and last name as an argument. </br>
